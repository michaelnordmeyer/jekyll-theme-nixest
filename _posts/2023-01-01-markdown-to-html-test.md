### Block-Quote Tag

Single-line block-quote:

Multi-line block-quote with a cite reference:

> That’s been one of my mantras – focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.

— Steve Jobs

### Code Tag

A code tag markups code `print("Hello World")` for better separation from the text around it.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should *italicize* text.

### Image Tag

The image tag will show the image of `/assets/icons/icon.webp`, if it exists:

![Image Alt Text](/assets/icons/icon.webp "Image Title Text")

### Pre-Formatted Tag

This tag was generated from Markdown's code fencing (```) with CSS syntax:

```css
.header {
  margin: 2em 0;
  font-size: 36px;
  font-weight: bold;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```
