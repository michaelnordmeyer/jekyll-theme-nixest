This is an open-an-editor-an-just-start-writing theme. Compared to [“Nixer”](https://jekyll-theme-nixer.michaelnordmeyer.com/), which has title support, “Nixest” doesn’t show any, but only the first 150 characters of a post in places where titles normally are displayed. This means the beginning of posts should use those characters for something reasonable like a summary or introduction and shouldn’t have any titles. It’s up to the writer to make this approach work.

The feature set is explained in the [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/jekyll-theme-nixest).
